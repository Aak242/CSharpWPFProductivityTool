# Features üöÄ
Interactive elements: The program has a user-friendly interface with interactive elements, such as the pull out menu, that work as expected when clicked or tapped.
Persistent storage: The program allows you to save the details of your tasks in a database, so you can access them anytime and anywhere.
Edit, update, and delete tasks: You can easily modify your saved tasks from the program, by changing their name, start time, end time, or description. You can also delete any task that you no longer need.
Search and sort tasks: You can search for your saved tasks by their name or description in the dynamic table on the ‚ÄúView All Tasks‚Äù page, for more convenience and efficiency. You can also sort the results by clicking on the buttons for ascending or descending order of task name, start time, end time, or any other category.
Validation: The program prevents you from adding a task without filling in all the required information, such as the start and end time of the task. It also displays an error message to indicate what is missing or wrong.
View all tasks: The program displays all your saved tasks and their details in a dynamic table on the ‚ÄúView All Tasks‚Äù page. You can sort the results by ascending or descending order of task name, start time, or end time.
Notification system: The program provides an option to remind you of your tasks with notifications. You can choose to receive a notification five minutes before the start of a task, when the task begins, and when the task ends. The program also handles cases where there is less than five minutes before a task begins, or where the start time of a task has already passed.

# Tech Stack üíª
The program is developed using Visual C#, an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language that allows for creating an easily navigable and versatile program with many inbuilt features. C# is a statically-typed language that catches errors before the program is run, and runs faster than dynamically typed languages. It also supports cross-platform development, which adds more flexibility and compatibility.


The program uses Visual Studio 2017 (Build Release 15.9) IDE, which provides a rich set of tools and libraries for developing desktop applications. The program uses WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), a graphical subsystem that enables designing the UI of the program with better ease of access and usability. WPF also offers greater control and feasibility for creating in-app animations and effects.
